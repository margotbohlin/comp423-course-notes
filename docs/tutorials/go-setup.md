## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through creating a basic "Hello World"-like project in Go. You will set up a Dev Container and use Git to merge/push changes in your code and store your project's collective history.

## Prerequistes

Before beginning the tutorial, you should have these prerequistes:
1. GitHub- to track versions of your code
2. Git - to navigate throughout histories of your code and push changes 
3. Visual Studio Code - Any text editor will do, but VSCode is MY personal preference
4. Docker - this is where you will set up your Dev Container
